# ES Project Traffic Light With PCB Design & AVR Microcontroller

1 - On Demand Traffic Light Control (Source Code) 
    (Which You Can Open The Code) in this Folder 
    There Is Folder That Called On Demand Traffic Light Control Open it you Can 
    Find All The .h and .c Files and Open Then The Folders Inside it (Application / ECUAL / MCAL / Utilities).
    .h files ( app.h / button.h / led.h / timer.h / dio.h / bit_manipulation.h / interrupts.h / registers.h / types.h )
    .c files ( main.c / app.c / button.c / timer.c / dio.c ).

Traffic lights are signaling devices positioned at road intersections, pedestrian crossings, and other locations to control the flow of traffic.

Traffic lights normally consist of three signals, transmitting meaning to drivers and riders through colors and symbols including arrows and bicycles.

The regular traffic light colors are red, yellow, and green arranged vertically or horizontally in that order.

Although this is internationally standardized, variations exist on national and local scales as to traffic light sequences and laws.

You are required to implement a traffic lights system with an on-demand crosswalk button.

Crosswalk buttons let the signal operations know that someone is planning to cross the street, so the light adjusts, giving the pedestrian enough time to get across.

In the current scenario, vehicular traffic is increasing all over the world, especially in large urban areas. With the ever - increasing number of road users and the limited resources provided by the existing infrastructures, intelligent traffic control will become a very important issue in the future. These needs led to an increased demand for the traffic control system. Therefore, there is a need to improve traffic control to better accommodate this increasing demand and to preserve pedestrians from accidents and to implement the movement of pedestrians first and then cars to preserve the lives of pedestrians. 
In this project, we will show the improvement of traffic light control on the road.
